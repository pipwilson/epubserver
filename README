A simple sever that delivers an openpub (Atom) file listing the .epub files in a location on your file system so that you can host a custom catalog for your ebook reader without needing to use a piece of more heavyweight ebook management software.

It is written in PHP and uses http://sourceforge.net/projects/oplsepublibrary/ to parse the .epub files.

It is GPL licensed.

This code lives in git on:

Library modifictions
====================

Feedcreator has been modified to:

* allow the @type of <link rel="alternate" ... > of atom:entry to be set, since epub files are application/epub+zip
* allow multiple <link> elements in atom:entry to allow for linking to book covers
* remove PIE and Atom 0.3 support

oplsepublibrary has been modified to:

* disable the removeSimpleXml() call, which does not correctly flatten Array structures (i.e. multiple authors)
* remove folder setting in getContentFile() if the contentFolder is "./", since the zip file comparison will not work otherwise
* some of the comment typos have been changed, but only as I see them in the bits of code I've used
