A simple sever that delivers an openpub (Atom) file listing the .epub files in a location on your file system so that you can host a custom catalog for your ebook reader without needing to use a piece of more heavyweight ebook management software.

It is written in PHP and uses http://sourceforge.net/projects/oplsepublibrary/ to parse the .epub files.

It is GPL licensed.
